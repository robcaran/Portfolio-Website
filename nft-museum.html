        <h2> Problem </h2>
        <p> Most of the NFT transactions happen on the web as most NFT markeplace apps are exclusively web apps. This means there's a large gap in the mobile market which, ironically, only seems to be growing.
        </p>
        <p>According to Google Analytics’ Benchmarking feature, which provides aggregated industry data from companies that share their data.Mobile devices drove 61% of visits to U.S. websites in 2020, up from 57% in 2019.
          Desktops were responsible for 35.7% of all visits in 2020. Globally, 68.1% of all website visits in 2020 came from mobile devices.</p>
        <p><b> Needles to say, the shift is heading towards mobile. </b></p>

    <h2> Objective </h2>
    <p> Build seamless mobile experience that handles the end-to-end sale of an NFT that users are truly satisfied with, as well as provide a enjoyable experience where users can browse and discover new collectibles. </p>

    <h3> Research and competitive analysis </h3>
    <p> If we search ‘NFT’ on the Apple app store, we can see that the results only show 2 NFT marketplace apps, the rest being automatic NFT generator apps, browsing apps, and crypto apps
        The one existing successful NFT marketplace mobile app is OpenSea which is extremely successful, likely due to it's lack of good competitiors, among other things.
        Although OpenSea does it great, it's rare that in a booming market like the web3 collectible space, there are little to no competitors that are doing something different.
        OpenSea's interface is bland, barely meets accessibility standards with condensed fonts and very small font sizes, and little to no microanimations to give the user experience some interest. </p>

  <h3> Style guide </h3>
  <p> Following Apple’s iOS Guidelines, I developed a typography scaling system, along with an expressive color palette to give the application some spice.  </p>
